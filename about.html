      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I’ve been creating stories since I was a kid, sketching characters and scenes 
		from the world around me. One of my earliest achievements was getting a comic 
		strip published in a local newspaper as a teenager—a moment that convinced me 
		my passion for storytelling was more than just a hobby. I later earned a 
		degree in Animation from the Art Institute of Houston and have continued 
		learning, experimenting, and refining my craft ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, I'v honed my skills working in games, comic books and storyboards for independent films, 
		where I enjoy transforming concepts into compelling visuals. I value 
		punctuality, clear communication, and a friendly approach to collaboration, 
		ensuring each project runs smoothly. At the heart of my work is a commitment 
		to bringing narratives to life in a way that captivates readers and viewers 
		alike.
